                    <h5>Hi there!</h5>
                    <p>I'm Prethel Alam, a passionate and driven student at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). I am pursuing my second bachelor's degree in computer science. I graduated Magna Cum Laude in May 2023 with a B.S. in Healthcare Management from UTD.</p>
                    <p>My journey into the world of technology began during my Healthcare Management studies, where I discovered the transformative potential of technology in the healthcare industry. I realized that significant advancements in healthcare could be achieved through technological innovation, sparking my interest in becoming a catalyst for positive change in this field. Determined to make a difference, I embarked on a self-taught programming journey. With a borrowed C++ textbook from a friend, I built my first projects: a text adventure game and a candy store manager program. These initial projects ignited a passion for programming, leading me to explore further. I soon found myself captivated by the curriculum of UTD's Computer Science program. The prospect of diving deep into this new discipline excited me, and I began learning Java, a language extensively used in my coursework.</p>
                    <p>This journey has allowed me to develop various projects and deepen my understanding of programming concepts. I am expanding my skill set by teaching myself HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript by creating a fully functioning and responsive website to showcase my abilities and further immerse myself in Computer Science. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the fascinating intersection of healthcare and technology, always seeking new ways to make a meaningful impact.</p>
                    <p>Let's connect and create something extraordinary together! Feel free to contact me at prethelalam@gmail.com or connect with me on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/prethelalam/">LinkedIn.</a>
