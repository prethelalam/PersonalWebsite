                    <h2>Short-Term Goals</h2>
                    <p>My short-term goals include securing an internship every summer until I graduate to acquire hands-on industry experience. I am committed to developing a high-level project each semester highlighting my healthcare, computer science, and coding expertise, providing tangible evidence of my capabilities to prospective employers. I aim to achieve proficiency in web and app development and to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Furthermore, I aspire to graduate with honors from the University of Texas at Dallas and have a job offer upon completing my degree.</p>

                    <h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
                    <p>My long-term objectives include securing a full-time software engineering position at a leading healthcare software company, a software firm, or a technology company. In these roles, I aim to refine my existing skills and acquire new competencies, with the ultimate goal of advancing to the position of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at a respected organization. Additionally, I intend to develop my own Electronic Health Record (EHR) software that integrates machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance clinical care quality and patient outcomes while alleviating the administrative burden on healthcare providers and their staff.</p>
