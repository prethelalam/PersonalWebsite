                    <!--description of this website-->
                    <p>I built a personal portfolio website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, teaching myself these technologies in the process. The website showcases my skills, relevant coursework, projects, experiences, future goals, and hobbies/interests. It serves as a professional platform to present my capabilities to potential employers, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of who I am and what I bring to the table.</p>
        
                    <!--description of consultant website-->
                    <p>I developed a professional website for an independent consultant affiliated with Ambit Energy, during which I taught myself HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The site highlights both Ambit Energy's business and the consultant's services, aiming to attract potential clients. It provides detailed information about Ambit Energy and the consultant, emphasizing why users should choose my client over the competition. The goal is to enhance the consultant's online presence and create an informative, engaging platform that drives business and services inquiries.</p>
        
                    <!--description of med minder-->
                    <p>I developed an iOS app called MedMinder using Swift. MedMinder allows users to store and manage their medication information. The app enables users to update their medication list, helping them keep track of what medications they've taken in the past, including dosages, times, and duration. Designed with responsiveness in mind, MedMinder ensures an optimal user experience on all iOS devices.</p>
