            <!--description of this website-->
            <p>In this project, I took the initiative to self-teach HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to develop a personal website. This site serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skillset and programming portfolio, highlighting my proficiency in front-end web development and my dedication to continuous learning.</p>

            <!--description of consultant website-->
            <p>I developed a professional website for an independent consultant affiliated with Ambit Energy, during which I taught myself HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The site highlights both Ambit Energy's business and the consultant's services, aiming to attract potential clients. It provides detailed information about Ambit Energy and the consultant, emphasizing why users should choose my client over the competition. The goal is to enhance the consultant's online presence and create an informative, engaging platform that drives business and services inquiries.</p>
